## **1. Why Marsha-H1?**

### **AI Compute is Bottlenecked**  
- **CPUs dominate AI, but they’re not always the best solution.**  
- **PCIe bottlenecks, high power draw, and limited availability** make them inefficient for many real-world AI applications.  
- **90%+ of enterprise IT & edge AI runs on CPUs**, yet most frameworks fail to optimize for them.  

**Marsha-H1** solves this by enabling **native AI acceleration on every CPU core**, removing the need for external accelerators.

## **2. Architecture Overview**  

Marsha-H1 is built on **hyper-heterogeneous AI compute principles**, optimizing CPU-native execution at every level:  

🔹 **AVX-512 Utilization** – Vectorized execution for matrix-heavy AI workloads.  
🔹 **AMX-TILE Optimizations** – 16×16 INT8 block matrix acceleration for deep learning inference.  
🔹 **VNNI (Vector Neural Network Instructions)** – 4x throughput boost for transformer models.  
🔹 **Memory-Aware Execution** – **Locks model weights into L2/L3 cache** for reduced latency.  

💡 **Result?** AI workloads execute **3× faster** than standard CPU baselines while maintaining power efficiency.
